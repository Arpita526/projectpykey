# projectpykey

📌 What This Project Is

This is a simple keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. The main goal behind building this was to:
- Learn about how input capturing works
- Understand how keyloggers are built
- Be more aware of potential vulnerabilities
- Improve my Python scripting skills in a cybersecurity context

🛠️ Requirements

To run this script, you need:

- Python 3.x installed  
- `pynput` library (install via pip)

```bash
pip install pynput

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the script.
Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Run the script:

bash: python keylogger.py
Keystrokes will be recorded in a file called log.txt.

This script is for offline, local use only in a safe and consented environment.

⚠️ Important Note

This is a very basic Python keylogger made for educational purposes only.
